# Weekend jQuery Server Calculator


## Description

I completed a project to create a calculator which worked in the following manner.
<li> Take inputs in from the client side. </li>
<li> Send those inputs to the server. </li>
<li> Run a function to do the arithematic within the server. </li>
<li> Send the result back to the client side. </li>
<li> Append the result, and a history of calculations, to the DOM. </li>
